# Module with custom functions for plots

After several months of study and practice, I've defined my standard in terms of (some plots).
Here I've create a Python module I import in my project with some custom functions for my plots.

Since is a very simple module (and not a package) I've decided to use this repository just for distrubuting the module.
This means that I've not created the necessary files to import the module directly from this repo; but you can clone this repo
and import the module for every project, if you like it (and this is what I'm actually doing).

Maybe in the future, when the modules will be more, I will create a package so that we can import it directly from there.
